In Hangman, the word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. Otherwise, the other player may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram.
